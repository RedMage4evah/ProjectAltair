        <h1>What is Project Altair about?</h1>
        
    <p>
        Years ago, I watched Re:Creators, an anime from 2017. I enjoyed the story, it was a pretty good anime. One thing stuck in my mind about it, and it was how one of the characters came to be. <br><br>
        
        In a setting where characters from various authors come to life in the world of their creators, Altair was a creation of MANY creators. Fan works shaped who she was, way beyond her original creator's initial concept art.<br><br>
        
        At first I thought nothing of it. It was a neat concept for sure. We can see it happen with stuff like Vocaloid songs, fan stories and reimaginings. Popular traits of a character in one fan work get adopted as a part of that character.<br><br>
        
        Fast forward to 2023. AI is making waves, and people are clamoring against it. Rightfully so. It's soulless, it's awful, it's made from data scraped without consent, its very use robs many artists from their ability to find work.<br><br>
        
        That's when the idea started germinating. I saw people pointing out free alternatives exist. People stepping forward, willing to create for the love of creating, not for the sake of money. And it got me thinking.<br><br>
        
        Around that same time, I watched a video about the skeleton trumpet gif, its origin and how it undoubtably transcended its original purpose, way after its creator's demise. It resonated with me, because it was very much in the same vein as Altair in that regard. An idea divorced from its originator, doing its own thing and still being used to this day.<br><br>
        
        Now it's almost the end of 2025 as I write this, and I've had enough of waiting. More and more people are slowly integrating the theft machine into their workflow, but it doesn't have to be that way. To hell with all these excuses, lack of time, lack of money. To hell with the convenience of a machine. It's not needed. People can create, together, as they've always done, piggybacking off of each other freely. It's only been mostly implicit in the past.<br><br>
        
        Project Altair is explicitly a repository of ideas that are put there to be grown by the community, and to help the community grow. Subjects to doodle, write about, make all manners of art about, all free for others to draw from. Make art, watch it be used to make more art. No AI, only humans working together in a massive jam session for the love of art.<br><br>
        
        There's still a long way to go, but I believe it can work out.<br><br>
