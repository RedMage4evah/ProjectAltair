# ProjectAltair
Community-driven OC growth

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:

1. Fill the form at https://redmage4evah.github.io/ProjectAltair/submit.html
2. Wait for me to make a character folder and file for it
3. Upload extra material and make edits to send as pull requests on any existing character

ANY CONTRIBUTION MATTERS!!!

- Have an idea for an OC but no drawing skills? Scribble something!
- Feel inspired to draw an OC whose profile you like, but struggle with hair/ hands/ clothing/ etc? That's fine! send it!
- Think you could fix the hands or give a better haircut to a character? Go for it!
- Maybe you just want to pose the character as practice? send your doodles!
- You can do 3D models? Make one! Someone can rig it!

You do NOT have to do the entire thing! make it exist first, make it good later!

Also, to address the fact that this is all free labor, yes, but...

1. You are building upon other's work they have willingly given out
2. Nothing's stopping other users from paying you to produce more. Sure the end result will be free to use, but you deserve to be paid for anything that isn't done for your leisure.
