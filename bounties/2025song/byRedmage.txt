Bounty: song about 2025

(I dunno how to notate the rythm or explain it so feel free to adapt to your liking)

Title:

Took the kids to school and they were chanting "six seven"
What a bunch of fools I say as the one who taught them
And to those who fail to understand how it's so fun
I can always say "At least it's not 21"

The people have elected to bring Trump back in power
He's posting on his Truth Social account every hour
His sanity is slipping and his mind's almost all gone
Trying to imply that it was worse in 21

Middle of the decade and AI is still alive
Millions of rainforest acres to burn for likes
Ragebait on a website whose owner we want gone
Put an X on AI and block until it's done

It's twenty five
It's twenty five
A quarter doubled for a ten year grind
It's twenty five
It's twenty five
It makes us fat shoveling slop online

Wars are breaking out and the public's pinning the blame
"It's this or this or that or whatever gets me fame"
Doomscrolling through all that is like the opposite of fun
Laugh at a meme for levity and keep scrolling on

(I'm not sure what else to add tbh)
