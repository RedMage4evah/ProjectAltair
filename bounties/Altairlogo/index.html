    <h1>Altair Logo</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Bounty description</h2>
      <p style="font-size:1.3rem;line-height:1.8;">
      
      A logo for Project Altair.<br><br>
        
      The Holopsicon from Re:Creators takes the form of a violin which is why the current logo is one. Obviously, we can't be using the same violin, nor would it be in the spirit of the project to use free vector art from the Internet.<br><br>
        
      So here's the assignment: Make a violin logo that embodies the Holopsicon more as a concept (An array of works that make up the core of a character)<br><br>
        
      Maybe it's surrounded with artist tools? Maybe it's a paintbrush itself? I dunno, I'll be opening a discussion about it too!
